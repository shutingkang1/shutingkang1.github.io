Hi, my name is Shuting Kang and I am pursuing my Master's degree at Columbia University in the fall of 2022. I am actively looking for an internship position for the summer of 2023. I have experience in data management, analysis, and visualization in R, SAS, and Python. I am a public health enthusiast and also have a particular interest in building machine learning models for applications in different fields.
